								<h2><a href="https://github.com/TeachMeTW/TeachMeTW.github.io">This Website</a></h2>
								<p>This website is my first dip into web development and HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I look forward to improving it.
									Currently this website was not built from scratch. I utilized templates and some existing scripts in order to make it work. 
									In the future where I have improved, I plan on building more sites with different functions and from scratch.

								<h2>Cyber City (WIP)</h2>
								<p>Utilized Heroku, Cytoscape.js, Deck.gl, and python in order to create a simulation of a city and their infrastructures for Argonne National Laboratory. Worked with
									another intern where I focused on the web/python aspect while my partner worked on the unity aspect. Utilized web scraping in order to get list of infrastructures aka
									list of water stations, power plants, emergency services from websites which was turned into JSON then CSV for my map rendition. The list had addresses of the buildings, which
									I used to in a geolocating algorithm in order to get their latitude and longitudes.
